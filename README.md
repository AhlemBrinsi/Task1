Responsive Landing Page:

Design and implement an interactive navigation menu that enhances user experience with responsive behavior. The menu should have the following features:

Fixed Position: The navigation menu should remain visible at the top of the page as the user scrolls.
Interactivity: Use JavaScript to change the background color, font color, or style of the menu when scrolling or hovering over menu items.
HTML Structure: Utilize HTML to structure the navigation menu.
CSS Styling: Apply CSS for styling the menu, ensuring it is visually appealing and responsive across different screen sizes.

This combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will result in a dynamic and user-friendly navigation experience.
